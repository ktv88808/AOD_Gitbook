# 🏝 AOD Land

Land is an important NFT asset in the game. You need to buy land before you can officially start the game. You will build buildings of various purposes and functions on this land, and use these buildings to collect resources, train soldiers, upgrade technology and other business activities, so that it becomes a strong and prosperous base. You rely on this base to resist the biochemical invasion of the outside world, expand your territory, and fight everywhere, become a hero in the end times and troubled times, and achieve great achievements.

Due to the destruction of the world by biochemical disasters, the world is no longer as full of habitable areas as before. There are only more than 40,000 pieces of land in the whole world suitable for survivors to live in and establish a base. These lands are spread across continents on every continent of the world. Players can choose a plot in any area of the world map as their birthplace, as if they are really in a corner of the apocalypse. Each piece of land in the map is equivalent to an NFT asset, and the more land you own, the more digital wealth you have. These NFT lands can also be traded for real wealth.

Each commander can not only own a piece of land or base, the more land you can have, the more base you can have, which means you can get more resources and wealth than other players. So please fight for more living space for your residents and accumulate more power for your grand plan. Different NFT lands have different terrain features and properties, so the bases established by players on different plots are also different, and this is not only reflected in appearance. For example, some base areas are rich in stone, while others are rich in oil. Some bases are suitable for researching technology, while others are more suitable for training soldiers.
