#### GameUnion: The story of AOD
----------
Breakthroughs in biotechnology have not only eliminated many diseases and made significant contributions to the progress of human civilization, but also buried huge hidden dangers. An accidental leak in a laboratory spreads a biological virus to the outside world. It starts with a region, then a city, then a country, and then the whole world. Viruses turn living beings into biological weapons that have no consciousness and thoughts and can only kill. Human existence is facing unprecedented challenges, and many people have been killed. The surviving people united, they established bases, supported each other, jointly resisted the attacks of biochemical monsters, and sought a way out for the survival and future of mankind.
